# Pong
Pong is a table-tennis themed sports video game, featuring simple 2D graphics. It was manufactured by ATARI and released
in 1972. This is a basic implementation of the game created following an YouTube tutorial, which can be found at this

## Explanation
Players control an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can complete
against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and
forth. The goal is for each play to each eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return
the ball to the other.
